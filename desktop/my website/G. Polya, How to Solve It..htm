        <ol>

            <li>
                UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <b> First.</b> You have to <em> understand</em>
                        the problem.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        What is the unknown?  What are the data?  What
                        is the condition?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Is it possible to satisfy the condition?  Is the
                        condition sufficient to determine the unknown?
                        Or is it insufficient?  Or redundant?  Or
                        contradictory?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Draw a figure.  Introduce suitable notation.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Separate the various parts of the condition. Can
                        you write them down?

                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                DEVISING A PLAN
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <b> Second.</b> Find the connection between the
                        data and the unknown.  You may be obliged to
                        consider auxiliary problems if an immediate
                        connection cannot be found.  You should obtain
                        eventually a <em> plan</em> of the solution.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Have you seen it before?  Or have you seen the
                        same problem in a slightly different form?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <em> Do you know a related problem?</em> Do you
                        know a theorem that could be useful?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <em> Look at the unknown!</em> And try to think
                        of a familiar problem having the same or a
                        similar unknown.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <em> Here is a problem related to yours and
                        solved before.  Could you use it?</em> Could you
                        use its result?  Could you use its method?
                        Should you introduce some auxiliary element in
                        order to make its use possible?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Could you restate the problem?  Could you
                        restate it still differently?  Go back to
                        definitions.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If you cannot solve the proposed problem try to
                        solve first some related problem.  Could you
                        imagine a more accessible related problem?  A
                        more general problem?  A more special problem?
                        An analogous problem?  Could you solve a part of
                        the problem?  Keep only a part of the condition,
                        drop the other part; how far is the unknown then
                        determined, how can it vary?  Could you derive
                        something useful from the data?  Could you think
                        of other data appropriate to determine the
                        unknown?  Could you change the unknown or data,
                        or both if necessary, so that the new unknown
                        and the new data are nearer to each other?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Did you use all the data?  Did you use the whole
                        condition?  Have you taken into account all
                        essential notions involved in the problem?

                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                CARRYING OUT THE PLAN
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <b> Third.</b> <em> Carry out</em> your plan.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Carrying out your plan of the solution, <em>
                        check each step</em>.  Can you see clearly that
                        the step is correct?  Can you prove that it is
                        correct?

                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                Looking Back
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <b> Fourth.</b> <em> Examine</em> the solution
                        obtained.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Can you <em> check the result?</em> Can you
                        check the argument?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Can you derive the solution differently?  Can
                        you see it at a glance?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Can you use the result, or the method, for some
                        other problem?
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
