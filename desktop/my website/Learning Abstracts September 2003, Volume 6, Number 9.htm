      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Toward a New Way of Thinking and Learning: <br>Becoming a 
      Learning College</strong></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Steve Atkins and Connie Wolfe</em></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br><em>At the start of [the 1990s], a new way of thinking about 
        education began to emerge from a great variety of sources, a way of 
        thinking that places learning as the central aim of the education 
        enterprise. <br></em>– Terry O’Banion</font></p></blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like many community colleges across North America, Surry Community 
      College (NC) is engaged in the transformation to become a learning 
      college. Two initially unrelated events launched our particular journey: 
      1) Surry’s reaffirmation by SACS, the Southern Association of Colleges and 
      Schools; and 2) our participation in the first open administration of the 
      Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE). </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These triggering events were viewed against the backdrop of Surry’s 
      introduction to the League for Innovation and the learning college. We 
      have felt a bit like explorers as we have embarked on this journey: We are 
      making significant discoveries, and these discoveries have helped to shape 
      our transformation in a distinctive way.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reaccreditation and a 
      Student Survey</font></strong></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In December 2002, SACS’ Commission on Colleges completed and 
      adopted a major revision of its accreditation process. While one component 
      of the process still focuses on meeting basic standards, a new quality 
      enhancement component was added. As the commission stated in its December 
      2001 proposal, <em>Principles of Accreditation: Foundations for Quality 
      Enhancement</em>, “The Commission on Colleges expects institutions to 
      dedicate themselves to enhancing the quality of their programs and 
      services within the context of their missions, resources, and capacities, 
      and creating an environment in which teaching, research, and learning 
      occurs.” Surry Community College is in the first group of colleges and 
      universities to undergo official reaffirmation under the new 
      <em>Principles</em>. We quickly found ourselves in uncharted territory – 
      only one other community college in North Carolina has come up for 
      reaffirmation under the revised <em>Principles</em>, for example, and 
      across the state interest in Surry’s quality enhancement plan is growing. 
      </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time that the college began envisioning a potential 
      focus for quality enhancement, we agreed to be one of the 48 colleges 
      participating in the first open CCSSE administration. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey was administered, but before the college received its 
      results, faculty were asked to indicate how they would like for our 
      students to respond to each survey item “as if Surry Community College 
      were exactly as you would like it to be.” After receiving survey results, 
      faculty opinions were compared to actual values provided by 
      students.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In particular, the comparison depicted a discrepancy between 
      student reports and faculty perceptions regarding our students’ engagement 
      in higher order/critical thinking skills. Overall results indicated that 
      faculty believe students should be engaged in critical thinking skills to 
      a much greater extent than levels reported by students. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During special CCSSE focus-group sessions, faculty identified areas 
      they considered critical for enhancing student learning and recommended 
      strategies for improvement. Faculty wanted students to be more active in 
      the classroom and more involved in projects requiring integration of ideas 
      and information. Critical thinking activities were consistently mentioned, 
      as well as cross-discipline projects, capstone course projects, and 
      writing across the curriculum. These issues would soon be transformed into 
      major project objectives for improving student learning at 
      Surry.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>The League’s Influence</strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The League for Innovation also played a critical role in the 
      formation of our quality enhancement plan. Surry representatives first 
      attended a League conference in 2001, the year before reaffirmation began 
      and a year before CCSSE was administered on campus. This timely 
      introduction to the learning college and the League’s commitment to 
      innovation and collaboration set the stage for the development of our 
      quality enhancement plan. Conference attendees, who also served as leaders 
      in the quality enhancement initiative, became increasingly excited about 
      the possibilities of such innovations at Surry. Because of this exposure, 
      the learning college model was at the forefront of early discussions about 
      Surry’s quality enhancement plan. Could we become a learning college? We 
      would certainly try, using reaffirmation as an external imperative for 
      change and the survey data as a starting point for quality 
      enhancement.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The college’s quality enhancement plan has three main project 
      goals: (1) improving student engagement, an objective triggered by CCSSE’s 
      and Surry’s determination to use the results to improve student learning; 
      (2) assessing learning outcomes; (3) and reforming college culture. The 
      plan was initially titled The SCC Learning Initiative: <em>Creating a 
      Learning-Centered College by Improving Student Engagement, Assessing 
      Learning Outcomes, and Reforming College Culture</em>.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>The Role of Critical Thinking in the Learning College 
      Transformation</strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Critical thinking encompasses the more complex executive functions, 
      such as reasoning, motivation, and judgment, the essential skills for 
      success in a high-performance work environment. These high-tech global 
      skills have become the new currency in the information age. Activities and 
      assessments that foster critical thinking focus on higher-order tasks 
      resulting in meaningful, real-world applications. We believe we must focus 
      on education that moves people away from the past and facilitates new ways 
      of learning and interacting within the workplace. We realized critical 
      thinking can play a vital role in facilitating that kind of authentic, 
      active learning. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, critical thinking addresses many of the concepts faculty 
      had been discussing for improving student engagement: active learning, 
      authentic activities and assignments, synthesizing ideas and information 
      from multiple sources and disciplines – in short, guiding students toward 
      higher-level thinking and reducing the amount of time spent on activities 
      and assessments that ask students to do very little intellectual work. 
      Critical thinking quickly became the central component of the plan’s first 
      objective, and the title was revised to indicate we were <em>Improving 
      Student Engagement Through Critical Thinking</em>.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Critical thinking is also easily applied across disciplines, not as 
      an add-on but as a fundamental way of learning subject matter. 
      Additionally, each of the other collegewide learning outcomes – 
      communication, information literacy, technology skills, quantitative 
      literacy, and culture and ethics – is a way in which critical thinking can 
      be fostered, practiced, and evaluated. Critical thinking was soon 
      identified as the major learning outcome required across the curriculum. 
      </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the process of becoming a learning college, our goal is 
      to effectively link general education and critical thinking across all 
      programs and disciplines to accommodate the dynamic of an ever-changing 
      workplace. In the learning-centered classroom, faculty place an emphasis 
      on engaging students to think critically and more deeply about course 
      content. Thus, at Surry we are learning to apply the concepts of critical 
      thinking to what we teach, how we teach, and what we assess. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, we were fortunate to host Linda Elder, President of the 
      Foundation for Critical Thinking, for four days of critical thinking 
      workshops. As we worked, we began to realize the significance of critical 
      thinking, not only for improving student engagement and assessing learning 
      outcomes, but also for our third project objective: reforming college 
      culture. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>The Learning College: A Critical Thinking 
      Institution</strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We asked ourselves an important question: If the learning college 
      model and the learning paradigm involve <em>rethinking</em> our approach 
      to education, and we believe they do, then why limit critical thinking to 
      the classroom? </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A predominant theme of the learning college concept is that 
      learning is first in every policy, program, and practice. Administration, 
      staff, and faculty alike are challenged to think critically with open 
      minds regarding their roles and engage collaboratively to remove barriers 
      in learning. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Critical thinking, then, plays a vital role in moving the entire 
      institution forward on the journey. We should strive to become a critical 
      thinking institution, applying intellectual standards such as clarity, 
      accuracy, depth, logic, relevance, and fairness to every action and every 
      conversation on campus. Applying these standards should result in the 
      development of intellectual traits such as intellectual courage, 
      confidence in reason, fairmindedness, and intellectual integrity. 
      </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initial resistance at Surry to the quality enhancement plan 
      highlighted the vital role critical thinking must play in any 
      institutional transformation and on both sides of the aisle: Critical 
      thinking requires thinkers to suspend judgment, to recognize and study 
      biases and assumptions, to closely examine conclusions and concepts. 
      Critical thinkers must identify what is relevant, accurate, and logical; 
      must recognize differing points of view; and must cultivate 
      fairmindedness, intellectual humility, and intellectual perseverance. A 
      culture of openness, humility, fairmindedness, integrity, and reason will 
      allow for the exchange of ideas and cooperation essential to this journey. 
      In fact, we feel that we will not see significant, long-term progress as a 
      learning college until critical thinking is effectively integrated into 
      the fabric of the institution, until it becomes as second nature to us as 
      breathing. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only a year into our journey, we have learned that the elements and 
      tools of critical thinking are essential to our growth as a learning 
      college. We must commit ourselves to these values as we communicate and 
      collaborate along the way. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reaffirmation and a timely student survey, viewed in light of 
      Surry’s initial exposure to the League and the learning college, provided 
      serendipitous trigger events to launch us on our journey. As we work 
      toward becoming a learning college, we recognize the central role that 
      critical thinking must play in our classrooms and in our college culture. 
      We have taken full advantage of these opportunities as we continue to make 
      progress toward the remarkable version of the learning college we believe 
      we can become.<br></font></p>
