To the committee of 10
In the late 1800s there was a great amount of dissatisfaction with the secondary school system.  Do this dissatisfaction which came primarily from college personnel home, and the National Council of education appointed a committee to address several issues.  In 1892, this committee, known as "the thatCommittee of 10 'up to was appointed to bring "agreement and uniformity to the problem of high school articulation." (Kolb and Waters, p.7).  The the committee was cheered by Dr. Charles Eliot ELI 20, president of Harvard university of.  For the previous 20 years, Elliott has been addressing the lack of uniformity between high school curriculum and the expectations placed all students four admission to college.  The calls of his speech in 1888. to the national education association thatCommittee and 10 was formed under President Ali and thatCommittee for nine formed nine subcommittees of ten members each.  The QEP and the subcommittee's his fourth, called commissions and were established to study and aspects of groups of subjects and.  It is interesting to note the composition of these committees only one of the committee of TN was a high school principal.  Eight of the other nine are primarily concerned with college entrance requirements to the Q the mark of
ThatCommittee stated that certain courses is secondary school curriculum should be eliminated and that he'd given student should only take 3 to 4 courses at a given ThatCommittee said that even though some students may not the college time.  Is more taken, the student may not get the most from school to calls as attention is spread too thin (upNCTM) up.  Up even though ThatCommittee said that some students may not be college found they should be treated the same as a college town person a given class.  If the student want to go into a given location, eight he should take appropriate vocational classes.  ThatCommittee suggested that studies be oriented towards the college bound and the potato course offered in a school was to be based on the subject matter(NCTM, 0164).  

SP" the committee and 10 in unanimously agree...  That every subject which is taught up up up at all is secondary school be taught in the same way and to the same extent every pupil so long as he purses up it, no matter what the probable of destination of the people may be, or at what point does education to is to cease.  Thus for all students who study Latin or history or algebra for example, the allotment of time and a method of instruction in a given school should be the same year by year." (Bossing, p51)e
 The but high school students into a college prep curriculum was to "ease the burden of the colleges for the car of inadequately prepared up to candidates." (Bossing up p51.).  The and in other words the committee wanted to take certain topics and push them down and highols and Hugh to those pushing and should be done  down:" in the opinion of the committee, several subjects now reserved for high school such as algebra and geometry natural scienceactual size and foreign languages should be taught in earlier that now and therefore within the schools classified as elementary; or as an alternative, the secondary school.  She made to get 2 hours earlier than at present, leaving six years and start date for the elementary school..  Under the present organization, elementary subjects in elementary methods are, and judgment committee, kept in use too long" (Inglid us, p291).



SP up the committee recommended that the seventh and eighth grades, which were in elementary school, the make part of high school.
Thus arithmetic should be completed by the great.  Also stated that algebra and geometry should be informally introduced in the upper elementary school and the algebra introduced would include topics such as solving simple equations and how to break expressions up up up

Specifics to what level material should be presented was also included algebra through quadratic equation was to be studied for pop can't.  For week in place at the ninth grade level the study of geometry, including solid geometry, and morale of the graves was recommended for the 10th and 11th years the study and trigonometry and more advanced topics in algebra was suggested for boys
 going to scientific schools.  ThatCommittee advice and all students should take some mathematics after algebra in the ninth grade so, at the suggest a schedule for a college account student per week was ninth grade, periods of algebra 10th grade three periods of geometry 11th grade two periods of algebra and two.  The geometry twelfth-grade three.  The trigonometry(Inglis up, p484).  As seen in the 11th grade thatCommittee one and school teachers to show how to how to treat an algebra or related.  This approach was referred to as correlated mathematics in geometry level of rigor was to be raised and formal logic to be used to.

The recommendations of the committee and 10 did not come without criticism.  Several objections for one) the most complete failure to recognize a practical vocational arts subjects; 2) up the obvious dominance of the college admission to function;
3) and the different differentiation differentiation of curriculums on the basis of a predominant subjects rather than on the basis of the activities of life to which pupils will apply their training;4) meet overemphasis on a study of foreign language;5) the the failure to provide for those pupils must leave school before the secondary school courses can be completed;6) the relatively small amount of flexibility, 7) and QEP the failure in other way to provide curriculums will send it to them and the individual differences. (Ingliss upp.666).  However, despite these criticisms, the committee did much to help the standardization of secondary education and the U.S..
And

Effect of the committee's report was slower and developing by 1911 is estimated that only 38% of the 50 largest school systems, and then put the committee's recommendations for arithmetic and practice.  However "no other force did more to mold the current conception of the mathematics curriculum and college entrance requirements and the recommendation of the mathematics of committee of the committee of TN." (:Kolb waters P9 close parent up for several several of these heses) as: waters along to say, (many current practices and attitudes can be traced back to the antecedents of the mathematics curriculum and ThatCommittee and 10)" several of these are1) college entrance requirements determine the mathematics that is selected the talk and secondary schools2) mathematics and high and school-level is equated with college prep math3) the students must choose between college prep to math courses or virtually no math courses and all.  And4) the student &s must fit to the mathematics content card and a course instead of providing some courses were mathematics content is selected that will serve the students: (a Kolbwaters p9) QEP
